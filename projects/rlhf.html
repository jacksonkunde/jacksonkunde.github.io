                <p>
                 Here, I implement a popular deep algorithm for aligning and training language models called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback [RLHF].
                 This implementation really gets into the details, you should check it out. I demonstrate how we can train a language model to exhibit different
                 behaviors based a reward function.

        <div class="description-container" style="padding: 10px;">
            <h2>Results with '.' Reward Function</h2>
            <p>We define our reward function as the number of periods in the generated text.
                It seems silly, but this will give us a sense of how our reward function changes
                our generated text.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following tables show how RLHF changes the model's generation, in this case GPT-2, conditioned on the phrase "This is"
